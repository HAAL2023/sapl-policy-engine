== General Information
Editing complex Access Control Policies with a regular text editor is inconvenient for Security Administrators and potentially error-prone. Since flawed Policies may result in severe security risks it seems to be beneficial to work on improving the editing capabilities and mitigate the root cause. 

This thoughts lead to the newly developed feature-rich VAADIN editor component for SAPL Policies that could seamlessly substitute regular a VAADIN `+TextArea+`. The name of that new component is `+SAPLTextArea+` and it resides in the package `+io.sapl.grammar.web+`.
