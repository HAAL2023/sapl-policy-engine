/**
 * This algorithm is used if policy sets and policies are constructed in a way
 * that multiple policy documents with a matching target are considered an
 * error. A PERMIT or DENY decision will only be returned if there is exactly
 * one policy set or policy with matching target expression and if this policy
 * document evaluates to PERMIT or DENY.
 *
 * It works as follows:
 *
 * 1. If any target evaluation results in an error (INDETERMINATE) or if more
 * than one policy documents have a matching target, the decision is
 * INDETERMINATE.
 *
 * 2. Otherwise:
 *
 * a) If there is no matching policy document, the decision is NOT_APPLICABLE.
 *
 * b) Otherwise, i.e., there is exactly one matching policy document, the
 * decision is the result of evaluating this policy document.
