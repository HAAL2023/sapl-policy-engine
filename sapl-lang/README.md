# SAPL Engine Core

This module contains the grammar definition and all core components of the policy engine.
In most cases, users will not use this as a dependency directly. Use `sapl-pdp-embedded` or
`sapl-spring-pdp-embedded` to use the engine embedded in a project.
For connecting to a remote PDP server use `sapl-pdp-remote` or `sapl-spring-pdp-remote`.
